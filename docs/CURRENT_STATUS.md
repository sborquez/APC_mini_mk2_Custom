# Current Status - Step Sequencer Implementation

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. **Controller Initialization**
- ‚úÖ Script loads successfully
- ‚úÖ All components initialize without errors
- ‚úÖ Controller lights up
- ‚úÖ MIDI communication established

### 2. **Drum Group Component**
- ‚úÖ 4√ó2 drum pads (8 pads total)
- ‚úÖ Drum pad selection
- ‚úÖ Mode toggle button (selection vs playable)
  - **Selection mode** (button OFF/greenish): Pads only select drums, don't play
  - **Playable mode** (button ON/green): Pads trigger drum sounds

### 3. **Step Sequencer Grid**
- ‚úÖ 8√ó4 step grid (32 steps total)
- ‚úÖ Matrix is connected and receiving input
- ‚úÖ Grid resolution component (8 resolutions: 1/32t to 1/4)
- ‚úÖ Resolution button works (button 94)

### 4. **Control Buttons**
- ‚úÖ Mode toggle (button 92)
- ‚úÖ Resolution cycle (button 94)
- ‚úÖ Accent/Soft buttons (visual feedback only)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### 1. **Play Mode Issues**
The playable mode for drum pads works, but there might be some quirks with the drum group component. This is because:
- The APC mini mk2 sends MIDI on channel 10 (drum channel)
- The `selection_only` mode needs proper drum rack device detection
- When no drum rack is present, pads may not respond correctly

**Workaround**:
- Make sure you have a **Drum Rack** loaded on the selected track
- The drum rack should have samples loaded in the pads
- Try selecting different drum pads to see which ones have samples

### 2. **Note Sync with Ableton**
The step sequencer can ADD notes but doesn't show EXISTING notes from the clip. This is because:
- The `NoteEditorComponent` needs to read the clip's current notes
- We haven't implemented the visual feedback loop for existing notes
- The component updates when YOU press buttons, but doesn't reflect what's already in the clip

**Current Behavior**:
- ‚úÖ You can ADD steps by pressing pads - they light up WHITE
- ‚úÖ You can REMOVE steps by pressing again - they turn OFF
- ‚ùå Steps that already exist in the clip DON'T show on controller
- ‚ùå Editing in Ableton doesn't update controller LEDs

**What This Means**:
- You're editing "blind" - you can add/remove notes but can't see what's already there
- Best workflow: Start with empty clip, add notes via controller
- Or: Ignore controller display and edit in Ableton's clip view

### 3. **Missing Features** (Temporarily Disabled)
- ‚ùå **Playhead visualization**: Current playing step doesn't light up green
- ‚ùå **Page navigation**: Can't navigate to different pages yet (buttons 84, 85)
- ‚ùå **Loop selector**: Can't see which pages have notes
- ‚ùå **Velocity control**: Accent/soft buttons don't actually change velocity

## üéØ How to Use Current Implementation

### Basic Workflow

1. **Load a Drum Rack**
   - Create a MIDI track in Ableton
   - Add a Drum Rack instrument
   - Load some drum samples into the pads

2. **Switch to Drum Mode**
   - Press the pad mode button on your APC mini mk2
   - The controller should switch to drum mode

3. **Select a Drum Pad**
   - Press button 92 (top-left control pad) to ensure you're in **Selection Mode** (button OFF/greenish)
   - Press one of the 8 drum pads (bottom left)
   - The selected pad should light up

4. **Add Steps**
   - Look at the top 8√ó4 grid (32 step pads)
   - Press any step pad to ADD a note
   - Press again to REMOVE the note
   - White = note ON, black = note OFF

5. **Play**
   - Press play in Ableton Live
   - Your pattern should play
   - The drum sound you selected will trigger on the lit steps

6. **Change Resolution**
   - Press button 94 (top-right control pad area)
   - Cycles through: 1/32t, 1/32, 1/16t, **1/16**, 1/8t, 1/8, 1/4t, 1/4
   - Check the log file to see current resolution

7. **Switch to Playable Mode**
   - Press button 92 (mode toggle) to turn it ON (green)
   - Now drum pads trigger sounds when pressed
   - You can finger drum while sequencing

### Grid Resolution Reference

| Resolution | Step Length | 32 Steps = |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 1/32t     | 0.083 beats | ~1 bar     |
| 1/32      | 0.125 beats | 1 bar      |
| 1/16t     | 0.167 beats | ~1.3 bars  |
| **1/16**  | 0.25 beats  | **2 bars** ‚Üê Default |
| 1/8t      | 0.333 beats | ~2.7 bars  |
| 1/8       | 0.5 beats   | 4 bars     |
| 1/4t      | 0.667 beats | ~5.3 bars  |
| 1/4       | 1.0 beat    | 8 bars     |

At the default 1/16 resolution, each step = one 16th note, and 32 steps = 2 bars.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Drum pads don't make sound in playable mode"

**Check:**
1. Is a Drum Rack loaded with samples?
2. Is the track armed for recording?
3. Is the track's monitor set to "In" or "Auto"?
4. Are you in the correct pad mode (drum mode)?

**Solution**: Make sure Drum Rack has samples and track monitoring is enabled.

### "Step pads don't light up"

**Check:**
1. Are you in drum mode?
2. Is the step_sequence_matrix connected? (Check logs)
3. Did you select a drum pad first?

**Solution**: The step sequencer needs a MIDI clip to edit. Create one first.

### "Mode toggle doesn't work"

**Check:**
1. Look at the log file - does it show mode changes?
2. Is the button lighting up when pressed?

**Solution**: The mode toggle IS working according to logs. The issue might be with how the drum rack responds.

### "Notes in Ableton don't show on controller"

**This is expected behavior with current implementation.** The controller only shows notes YOU add via the controller, not notes that already exist in the clip.

**Workaround**:
- Start with an empty clip
- Build your pattern using only the controller
- Or ignore the controller display and use Ableton's piano roll

## üìä Technical Details

### Pitch Provider
Currently set to a fixed pitch (MIDI note 36 = C1, typically kick drum). This means:
- All steps you add will be for the same pitch
- You're essentially programming a single drum sound
- To program different drums, you need to manually change which drum pad you're editing

**Future Enhancement**: Make pitch provider follow drum pad selection automatically.

### Sequencer Clip
The `SequencerClip` helper monitors the target track and provides the active MIDI clip to the note editor. It automatically:
- Detects when a clip is selected
- Validates it's a MIDI clip
- Provides it to the note editor for editing

### Note Editor
The `NoteEditorComponent` handles:
- Adding notes at specific time positions
- Removing notes
- Grid quantization based on resolution
- Basic visual feedback (step on/off)

**What it doesn't handle yet**:
- Reading existing notes from clip
- Visual feedback for all clip notes
- Velocity variation
- Note length/gate

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. **Note Visualization**: Show existing notes from clip on controller
2. **Playhead**: Show current playing step (green blink)
3. **Page Navigation**: Implement prev/next page buttons
4. **Auto Pitch Following**: Update pitch when drum pad selected

### Medium Priority
5. **Velocity Control**: Make accent/soft buttons functional
6. **Multiple Pitches**: Edit different drums on different rows
7. **Note Length**: Control gate/sustain
8. **Loop Selector**: Visual feedback for pages with notes

### Low Priority
9. **Copy/Paste**: Copy patterns between pages
10. **Note Probability**: Random triggering
11. **Ratcheting**: Multiple note repeats per step

## üìù Log File Location

```
/Applications/Ableton Live 12 Lite.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/APC_mini_mk2_custom/logs/apc_mini_mk2_custom.log
```

Check this file to see:
- Component initialization status
- Mode changes
- Resolution changes
- Errors and warnings
- Button presses

## üéâ Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
1. ‚úÖ Controller lights up on startup
2. ‚úÖ Drum pads light up when selected (green)
3. ‚úÖ Step pads light up when pressed (white)
4. ‚úÖ Pattern plays when you hit play in Live
5. ‚úÖ Mode toggle changes between selection and playable
6. ‚úÖ Resolution button cycles through resolutions

## Summary

The step sequencer is **functionally working** but has limitations around visual feedback and note sync. You can build drum patterns, but you're doing it "blind" - the controller doesn't show what's already in the clip, only what you're adding.

This is a solid foundation that can be enhanced with the features listed above. The core functionality (adding/removing notes, resolution control, drum pad selection) is all working correctly.

**Recommended Usage**: Create new patterns from scratch using the controller, rather than editing existing patterns.
